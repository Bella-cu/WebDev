        <p style="background-color:#f4deaea1; margin-top: -65px; border: 2px solid #b0804a38; font-size: 23.1px; padding: 10px;">Anime, a style of animation that originated in Japan, has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century. The term "anime" is derived from the English word "animation," and it refers to a distinct form of animated media that incorporates vibrant art, unique character designs, and imaginative storytelling. The origins of anime can be traced to the pioneering works of early Japanese animators in the 1910s, such as Jun''chiro Tanaka and Osamu Tezuka, often referred to as the "God of Manga," whose work in the 1960s helped define modern anime. However, it wasn't until the 1970s and 1980s that anime began to gain widespread popularity, both in Japan and internationally. The rise of iconic series like "Astro Boy" and "Mobile Suit Gundam" marked the beginning of anime's global influence, with its unique blend of action, fantasy, and deep cultural themes. Today, anime continues to evolve, capturing audiences worldwide with its diverse genres and influential art style, making it a powerful form of entertainment and cultural expression.</p>

        <p style="background-color:#dac7a0a1; margin-top: -70px; border: 2px solid #b0804a38; font-size: 21.6px; float: right; padding: 10px; width: 50%; height: 352px;">Anime has deep roots in Japanese culture, which plays a vital role in shaping its distinct visual style and storytelling. Traditional Japanese art forms, such as ukiyo-e (woodblock prints) and calligraphy, have heavily influenced the vibrant colors, intricate details, and stylized character designs seen in many anime. Furthermore, Japanese folklore, mythology, and historical events are frequently woven into anime narratives, offering viewers a glimpse into Japan’s rich cultural heritage. Beyond aesthetics, anime reflects societal values, with themes like honor, perseverance, and family often taking center stage. As a result, anime is not just a form of entertainment, but a cultural expression that carries the essence of Japan’s past while adapting to its modern identity. Through this blend of culture and creativity, anime has become a global phenomenon, attracting audiences from all around the world.</p>

        <p style="background-color:#ad937ba1; margin-top: -70px; border: 2px solid #20181038; font-size: 21.6px; float: left; padding: 10px; width: 50%; height: 352px;">Manga and anime play a pivotal role in shaping Japanese culture and influencing global entertainment. Manga, which refers to Japanese comics or graphic novels, is often the source material for anime, which are animated adaptations of these comics. Manga provides intricate storytelling, allowing for deeper exploration of characters, themes, and worlds, while anime brings these stories to life with vibrant visuals, sound, and movement. The impact of both forms extends far beyond Japan, as they have gained an international following, transcending language and cultural barriers. Manga and anime influence various other art forms, fashion, and even social trends, fostering a unique connection between creators and fans. Together, they have become a cornerstone of global pop culture, offering an immersive experience that appeals to people of all ages.</p>
